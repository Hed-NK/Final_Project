# Project Objectives

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of COVID-19 statistics, including the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, and critical conditions, across various countries and continents. By visualizing and interpreting these metrics, the project aims to offer valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic.

# What can the app do?

This application presents three types of interactive visualizations. Bar Plot: Illustrates COVID-19 cases across different countries, color-coded by continent for easy comparison. Scatter Plot: Displays the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and cases, also color-coded by continent for clarity. Pie Chart: Provides a proportional view of COVID-19 cases, with segments color-coded by continent. Additionally, the app includes user-friendly sidebar filters, featuring sliders and dropdown menus to customize the data visualizations dynamically.

# How to use the app?

The application includes intuitive sidebar filters, featuring sliders to adjust the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and critical patients. Users can also select specific countries or continents using dropdown menus. Adjusting these filters dynamically updates the visualizations. Bar Plot: Clicking on any bar reveals the country name along with the corresponding number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and critical patients. Scatter Plot: Interacting with any scatter point displays detailed information, including the country name and the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and critical patients. Pie Chart: Hovering over any segment of the pie chart shows the continent, country name, and the number of COVID-19 cases.
